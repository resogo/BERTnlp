      "S/O: Pt has had a very eventful day. At~6:45 AM he was noted to have SBP 40's by NBP, with HR 60's. Initially responsive, but rapidly decreasing responsiveness followed by respiratory arrest. Pt was ambued with 100% FiO2, then intubated. An A-line was placed; we have consistently been able to easily draw blood from the line, but it appears dampened and reads quite a bit lower than the NBP, so we have been using the NBP all day. He soon required pressors for SBP 70's. He was started initially on Neo, which was titrated up to a max of 120 mcg/min with little if any effect. he was then started on Levo. Over several hours, with some difficulty, the Neo was weaned to off with the Levo as high as 40 mcg/min. He was transiently on Dopa, as high as 10 mcg/kg/min, but it was soon D/C'd d/t HR into the 140's. Around 1PM his BP again began to fall, into the 50's. His extremities were cold, and HR dropped into the 60's again. He was given 250cc fluid bolus, and Dopa was again attempted, at a lower dose. This time, however, he began to have lots of ventricular ectopy, including short runs of VT. Dopa was again D/C'd, Levo increased more, and he again stabilized for a few hours. About 7:45 he suddenly went into sustained VT. A-line tracing was flat (though is has never been reliable). In the interest of saving time, a cuff pressure was not checked. He was unresponsive, and was defibrillated once with 200J. He converted initially to ST with lots of ectopy, then settled down into NSR after a few minutes. \n",

Angiography had demonstrated a left ICA psuedoaneurysn/dissection. MRA showed no flow to R ICA, also R mastoiditis, and a left ear lesion. Patient underwent repair of pseudoaneurysm on July 2nd, with double stent placement. He returned to OR on 7-8 for coiling of aneurysm with stent placement. The patient has had episodes of SVT during his stay. He has additional history of recent anemia secondary to his epistaxis, as well as syncope. Hx also includes HTN, COPD, Etoh use ( 3 drinks/day), gout, basal cell CA, ? TIAs. \n",

He did have an episode of very low blood pressure, 50s systolic after being turned although he did not lose consciousness. He did have slurred speech and c/o pain in right arm. He was given a 500cc fluid bolus and NEO was increased to 10mics. He was noted to be in an SVT of 140s at that time. He did stabilize after a short while and was able to answer questions appropriately. Pupils equal and briskly reactive. The neo gtt was titrated back to pre-incident levels although it did need to be periodically increased in small increments for transient drops in pressure. HR returned to NSR, 70s-80s. He was noted to have PVCs, PACS, for a brief period after SVT broke. Placed on Heparin gtt at 600 units at 0230. Due for PTT at 0830. Magnesium replaced during the night. His right groin dressing with sanguinous drainage that has increased during the night and is now leaking out somewhat. Dr. Golini notified as NSicu does not want dressing touched.
