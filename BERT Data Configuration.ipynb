      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\n",
      "She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\n",
      "There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\n",
      "There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\n",
      "However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\n",

      "In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\n",
      "During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\n",
      "Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\n",

      "The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\n",
      "But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\n",
      "The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\n",
      "The patient did well post procedure .\n",
      "He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\n",
      "The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\n",

      "He received 6,000 rads to his mediastinum with external beam .\n",
      "Subsequently , he returned to Goo where he received another 3,000 rads via an endobronchial catheter , apparently due to recurrence .\n",
      "Over the pat three to four weeks , he started having increased dyspnea and noted wheezing .\n",
      "A bronchoscopy showed protrusion of the tumor into the right main stem bronchus with a positive needle biopsy , washings and brushings for squamous cell carcinoma .\n",

      "The tumor now involves the trachea as well as the right main bronchus .\n",
      "His major complaint was of persistent severe coughing and secretions .\n",
      "Ultimately , only codeine at 30 mg q6h controlled him and this was very affective .\n",
      "Inhalers provide only mild relief .\n",
      "He is aware of his prognosis .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Mr. Stoningi , Kansas .\n",
      "This involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .\n",
      "He did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .\n",
      "He underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .\n",
      "Following this , he was followed closely by Dr. Na .\n",
      "Over the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .\n",
      "He also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .\n",
      "The patient was referred here for further evaluation .\n",
      "Mr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "On physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .\n",
      "The blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .\n",
      "There were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .\n",
      "There was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .\n",
      "The cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .\n",
      "There was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .\n",
      "The liver was not palpable .\n",
      "There were diminished pulses in the legs .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "The hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .\n",
      "The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .\n",
      "The chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "I indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .\n",
      "Accordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .\n",
      "The study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .\n",
      "The right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .\n",
      "Using transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .\n",
      "The left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .\n",
      "An attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .\n",
      "On G Hemp performed open heart surgery .\n",
      "At the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .\n",
      "There was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .\n",
      "I have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .\n",
      "The valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .\n",
      "The surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .\n",
      "Mr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .\n",
      "Postoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .\n",
      "He had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .\n",
      "He seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .\n",
      "There was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .\n",
      "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .\n",
      "The patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .\n",
      "The heart appeared to be flaccid .\n",
      "We really have no good explanation of what this was all about .\n",
      "He was being treated for a possible pneumonia .\n",
      "He did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .\n",
      "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .\n",
      "The patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .\n",

      "Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\n",
      "Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient &apos;s increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .\n",
      "Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .\n",
      "In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .\n",
      "On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .\n",
      "On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .\n",
      "It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .\n",
      "At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .\n",
      "The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .\n",
      "Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .\n",
      "The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .\n",
      "The patient &apos;s prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .\n",
      "The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .\n",
      "Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .\n",
      "The patient &apos;s rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .\n",
      "Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "# 1. cerebrovascular accident .\n",
      "The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .\n",
      "This was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .\n",
      "The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .\n",
      "Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .\n",

      "It is discontinued at the time of transport .\n",
      "The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .\n",
      "During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .\n",
      "On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .\n",
      "There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .\n",
      "At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient &apos;s family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .\n",
      "What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .\n",
      "Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .\n",
      "Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .\n",
      "Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .\n",
      "As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .\n",
      "While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .\n",
      "Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .\n",

      "Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .\n",
      "EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\n",
      "We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\n",
      "Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\n",
      "The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\n",
      "It has been evaluated in the past without success .\n",
      "During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\n",
      "Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\n",
      "Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\n",
      "This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\n",
      "Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\n",
      "The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\n",
      "In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\n",
      "This has been evaluated by Dr. Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\n",
      "CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .\n",
      "A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .\n",
      "A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .\n",
      "The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .\n",

      "Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .\n",
      "It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\n",
      "It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\n",
      "The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\n",
      "We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\n",
      "This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\n",
      "The patient has glaucoma .\n",
      "Her medications are as listed below .\n",

      "I and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .\n",
      "Chest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .\n",
      "IN SUMMARY :\n",
      "The patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .\n",
      "She also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .\n",
      "It was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .\n",
      "Laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .\n",
      "Urinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .\n",
      "In view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .\n",
      "Repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .\n",
      "Renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .\n",
      "Dr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .\n",
      "He requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .\n",
      "Neither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .\n",
      "In view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .\n",
      "As a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .\n",
      "The patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .\n",
      "She was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .\n",
      "Sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .\n",
      "On the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .\n",
      "Her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .\n",
      "However , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .\n",
      "On 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .\n",
      "Her Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .\n",
      "On Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .\n",
      "She was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .\n",
      "In view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .\n",
      "On 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .\n",
      "Urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .\n",
      "A Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .\n",
      "An electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .\n",
      "No computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .\n",
      "She continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .\n",
      "Off her Ifex the patient &apos;s sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .\n",

      "The patient &apos;s white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .\n",
      "In addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .\n",
      "She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .\n",
      "Despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .\n",
      "A Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .\n",
      "On conservative therapy the patient &apos;s nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .\n",
      "A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .\n",
      "On 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Mr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .\n",
      "Over the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .\n",
      "He has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .\n",
      "Although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .\n",
      "The patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .\n",
      "He has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .\n",
      "He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\n",
      "On examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\n",
      "His blood pressure was 110/70 .\n",
      "Heart was 82 and regular .\n",
      "Respiratory rate was 16 .\n",
      "His jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .\n",
      "Lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .\n",
      "The first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .\n",
      "There was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .\n",
      "The abdomen was soft and nontender .\n",
      "There was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .\n",
      "The extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .\n",
      "The posterior tibialis pulses were intact .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .\n",
      "Albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .\n",
      "The chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .\n",
      "The ECG was paced .\n",
      "An outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .\n",
      "There was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .\n",
      "The aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .\n",
      "Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .\n",
      "Left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .\n",
      "There was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .\n",
      "In addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .\n",
      "The patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .\n",
      "The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient &apos;s family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient &apos;s age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .\n",
      "While in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .\n",
      "The patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .\n",
      "The patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .\n",
      "In addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .\n",
      "At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .\n",
      "He will be followed both by Dr. Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .\n",

      "Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\n",
      "In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\n",
      "His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\n",
      "Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\n",
      "At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\n",
      "The patient will be followed by Dr. Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\n",

      "After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\n",
      "Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\n",
      "Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\n",
      "It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\n",
      "Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .\n",
      "After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\n",
      "Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. Bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\n",
      "In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\n",
      "His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\n",
      "Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\n",
      "At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. Bridge &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\n",
      "The patient will be followed by Dr. Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n",

      "It was felt that endoscopy would be of value .\n",
      "A central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .\n",
      "After neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .\n",
      "This was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .\n",
      "Cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .\n",
      "The patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .\n",
      "Gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\n",
      "He was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\n",
      "He received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.\n",

      "Following the permanent stent placement , the patient &apos;s diet was slowly advanced .\n",
      "His serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\n",
      "Because of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\n",

      "Four large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .\n",
      "The patient &apos;s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .\n",

      "The patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .\n",
      "It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .\n",
      "The abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .\n",
      "He was returned to the operating room on 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .\n",
      "Tracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .\n",
      "There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the hospital on 01/15/93 and on the following day was taken to the operating room where he underwent a saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery , and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery .\n",
      "This operation was performed by Dr. Chitllik Kote .\n",
      "Intraoperative findings were as follows :\n",

      "The diagonal coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe .\n",
      "The circumflex marginal artery was small and only took a 1 millimeter probe tightly .\n",
      "The first main was anastomosed side to side to the diagonal and end to end to the circumflex marginal artery .\n",
      "The left anterior descending artery was then isolated , opened , probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe and anastomosed to the left internal mammary artery .\n",
      "The acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe tightly and a second main was anastomosed to this .\n",
      "The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on nitroglycerin at 50 mcg. per minute Levophed at 4 mcg. per minute and Lidocaine at 1 mg. r minute .\n",
      "The patient was extubated on postoperative day # 1 and transported to the routine postoperative care floor on postoperative day # 2 in good condition .\n",
      "The only issue of note during the patient &apos;s SICU course was a small right apical pneumothorax which disappeared on repeat chest x-ray .\n",

      "The V threshhold was changed from 0.6 millivolts/ 2.0 millivolts to 0.8 millivolts/ 4.0 millivolts .\n",
      "The V sensor was changed from 4 millivolts to 2 millivolts .\n",
      "It was felt that the atrial pacing would improve as the edema resolved .\n",
      "Meanwhile , the patient was AV paced using the epicardial wires .\n",
      "While on the routine postoperative care floor the patient continued to progress well .\n",
      "Of note , he developed a small right apical pneumothorax which was followed on serial films and found to be stable and was not causing the patient any respiratory distress .\n",

      "Her oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .\n",
      "Upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .\n",
      "There were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .\n",
      "She was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .\n",
      "She underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .\n",

      "It was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .\n",
      "This proceeded uneventfully .\n",
      "She was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .\n",
      "However , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .\n",
      "This appeared to be respiratory in origin .\n",
      "She was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .\n",

      "Her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .\n",
      "X-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .\n",
      "She was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\n",

      "Her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .\n",
      "She ruled out for myocardial infarction .\n",
      "She developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .\n",
      "This improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .\n",
      "She developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .\n",
      "She remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .\n",
      "Ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .\n",
      "However , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .\n",
      "This improved her cardiac function .\n",
      "She failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .\n",
      "She had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .\n",

      "This is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\n",
      "Mr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\n",
      "He had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\n",
      "His course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\n",
      "In August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\n",
      "He rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\n",
      "He was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\n",
      "An automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\n",
      "He was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\n",
      "Because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\n",
      "Mr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\n",
      "He was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\n",
      "Colonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn &apos;s disease with sparing of the rectum .\n",
      "A perirectal fistula was seen .\n",
      "Treatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\n",
      "On the evening of Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\n",
      "He presented to the April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\n",
      "He was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\n",
      "Hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\n",
      "He is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "Physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\n",
      "His CVP was 16 .\n",
      "He was on the balloon pump at the time .\n",
      "His chest was clear anteriorly .\n",
      "His cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\n",
      "No murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\n",
      "His abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\n",
      "His feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "Admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\n",
      "The sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\n",
      "Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\n",
      "There were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\n",
      "The chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "Mr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\n",
      "He was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\n",
      "It was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\n",
      "After replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\n",
      "He did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\n",
      "It was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\n",
      "He also remained intubated .\n",
      "Mr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn &apos;s disease .\n",
      "All of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\n",
      "As Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\n",
      "He was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\n",
      "Dr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\n",
      "Procainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\n",
      "Initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\n",
      "As Mr. Given &apos;s renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\n",
      "This resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\n",
      "He was able to get some fluid off as well .\n",
      "With getting some volume off , the patient &apos;s ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\n",
      "His cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\n",
      "On 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\n",
      "With a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\n",
      "The balloon pump was restored .\n",
      "He was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\n",
      "He continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\n",
      "Supportive care continued .\n",
      "Unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\n",
      "Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\n",
      "Mr. Given &apos;s blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\n",
      "Another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\n",
      "He had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\n",
      "Hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\n",
      "He did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\n",
      "His hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\n",
      "He continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\n",
      "Another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\n",
      "This resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\n",
      "He did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "On Given began developing periods of hypotension .\n",
      "The patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\n",
      "He began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "The patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\n",
      "Indicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\n",
      "He developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\n",

      "Noninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .\n",
      "A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .\n",
      "Of note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .\n",
      "After discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .\n",

      "1. Neurological :\n",
      "On admission the patient was intubated and sedated .\n",
      "Her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .\n",

      "After two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .\n",
      "Over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .\n",
      "By August 29th .\n",
      "At this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .\n",
      "She was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .\n",
      "After her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .\n",

      "3. Cardiovascular :\n",
      "Ms. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .\n",
      "She was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .\n",
      "She required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .\n",
      "At this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .\n",
      "A Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .\n",

      "At this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .\n",
      "An elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient &apos;s course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .\n",
      "Her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .\n",
      "At the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .\n",

      "Ms. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .\n",
      "She was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .\n",
      "On July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .\n",
      "These G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .\n",
      "She was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .\n",
      "At the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .\n",
      "This problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\n",
      "She is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .\n",
      "She has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .\n",
      "Ms. Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .\n",
      "These values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .\n",
      "Stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .\n",

      "6. Infectious disease :\n",
      "Ms. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .\n",
      "She ruled out by PPD .\n",
      "The initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .\n",
      "Because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .\n",
      "The course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .\n",
      "At this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .\n",
      "She then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .\n",
      "ON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .\n",
      "Shortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .\n",
      "After a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .\n",
      "On discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .\n",
      "Ms. Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .\n",

      "Ms. Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\n",
      "Her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .\n",
      "At the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .\n",
      "More active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .\n",
      "She has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .\n",
      "However , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .\n",

      "IN SUMMARY :\n",
      "Ms. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .\n",
      "Over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .\n",
      "Her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .\n",
      "Her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .\n",
      "Currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .\n",
      "Her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .\n",

      "This was considered her culprit lesion .\n",
      "This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .\n",
      "In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .\n",
      "Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .\n",
      "It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .\n",
      "She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .\n",
      "This was intermittent .\n",
      "The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .\n",
      "The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .\n",
      "It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .\n",
      "Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .\n",
      "She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .\n",
      "When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .\n",
      "Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .\n",
      "The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .\n",
      "He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .\n",
      "For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .\n",
      "The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .\n",
      "On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .\n",
      "There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .\n",
      "It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .\n",
      "She tolerated this well .\n",
      "Her medications were resumed .\n",
      "She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Bi Masase , KS .\n",

      "Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .\n",
      "This required a chest tube .\n",
      "Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .\n",
      "It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .\n",
      "However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .\n",
      "She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .\n",

      "2. Cardiac .\n",
      "The patient &apos;s blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .\n",
      "This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\n",
      "For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\n",
      "Her blood pressure responds well to this .\n",
      "Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\n",
      "The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\n",
      "This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\n",
      "Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\n",
      "The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\n",

      "They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\n",
      "They have opted for conservative management given the size .\n",
      "3. Respiratory .\n",
      "At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\n",
      "She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\n",
      "Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\n",
      "Her right lung field is clear .\n",

      "Her oxygen saturation has always been good .\n",
      "4. GI .\n",
      "The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\n",

      "Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\n",
      "Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\n",
      "These have all been negative .\n",
      "We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\n",
      "Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\n",
      "She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\n",
      "5. GU .\n",
      "The patient has had hypernatremia .\n",
      "She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\n",

      "Ms. May of 1998 .\n",
      "She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .\n",
      "Biopsy of this specific area was negative .\n",
      "Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .\n",
      "However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .\n",
      "Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .\n",
      "An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .\n",
      "The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .\n",
      "She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .\n",
      "The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .\n",
      "The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .\n",
      "ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .\n",
      "DNA content was deployed .\n",
      "On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .\n",
      "Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .\n",
      "She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .\n",
      "Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .\n",
      "Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .\n",

      "In the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .\n",
      "In early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .\n",
      "In 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .\n",
      "In early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. March of this year .\n",
      "CT imaging at that time was negative for disease .\n",
      "In April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .\n",
      "Thereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 06/14/00 .\n",
      "Most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the 06/16/00 .\n",
      "That hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .\n",
      "He was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .\n",
      "It was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .\n",

      "Primary closure of wound .\n",
      "HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :\n",
      "The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .\n",
      "At that time the patient &apos;s hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .\n",
      "The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .\n",
      "The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .\n",
      "A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .\n",
      "The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .\n",
      "However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .\n",
      "By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .\n",
      "However the patient was then subsequently transferred to 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .\n",
      "The patient was evaluated by Dr. Dentvailr. Medical Center .\n",
      "As the patient &apos;s early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .\n",
      "There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .\n",
      "At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient &apos;s sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .\n",
      "Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient &apos;s wound drainage appeared to subside .\n",
      "Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient &apos;s only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .\n",
      "The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .\n",
      "The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .\n",
      "He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .\n",

      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "The patient &apos;s sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient &apos;s precarious condition .\n",
      "Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .\n",
      "The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient &apos;s intermittent hypertension .\n",
      "The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .\n",
      "After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient &apos;s family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .\n",
      "This was obtained on Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .\n",
      "The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .\n",
      "The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .\n",
      "The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .\n",
      "The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .\n",
      "The graft used was a homograft .\n",
      "The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .\n",
      "The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient &apos;s sternum .\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\n",
      "There he continued to be hemodynamically stable .\n",
      "Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .\n",
      "In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .\n",
      "On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient &apos;s sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .\n",
      "The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .\n",
      "A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .\n",
      "The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\n",
      "At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .\n",
      "The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .\n",
      "Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .\n",
      "The patient &apos;s subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .\n",
      "The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .\n",
      "Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .\n",
      "The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient &apos;s Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .\n",
      "As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .\n",
      "However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient &apos;s intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .\n",
      "Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .\n",
      "The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .\n",
      "This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .\n",
      "At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .\n",
      "He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .\n",
      "He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .\n",
      "On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .\n",
      "Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .\n",
      "The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .\n",
      "The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient &apos;s indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .\n",
      "These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .\n",
      "Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\n",
      "The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .\n",
      "As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .\n",
      "The patient &apos;s condition continued to be improved .\n",
      "Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .\n",
      "In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\n",

      "Wound cultures from his buttock region revealed 1+ Acinetobacter , as well as 2+ diphtheroids with rare enterococci .\n",
      "A perirectal culture showed normal fecal flora , and a second wound culture also revealed diphtheroids and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .\n",
      "These were thought to be contaminants , and the patient was not treated for wound infection .\n",
      "( 2 ) PULMONARY - On 6/17/99 , the patient was noted to have markedly increased O2 requirements , with O2 sats noted in the low 80% on room air .\n",
      "This increased to 90-93% on four liters nasal cannula .\n",
      "The patient was noted to have increased wheezes on pulmonary exam .\n",
      "A STAT portable chest x-ray revealed markedly increased opacification in the right hemithorax , with increased markings on the left , which was consistent with pulmonary edema .\n",
      "An EKG was obtained , at that time , which showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 125 , with normal axis and no acute ST changes noted .\n",
      "The patient was given IV Lasix with improvement in his O2 saturations .\n",
      "It was also thought , at that time , given the patient &apos;s immobility that a pulmonary embolus was also a likely cause of the patient &apos;s hypoxia .\n",
      "However , at that time , the decision had been made to make the patient DNR / DNI , and it was not felt that an aggressive workup for pulmonary embolus was indicated at that time .\n",
      "Throughout the remainder of the patient &apos;s hospitalization , his respiratory status was stable .\n",
      "( 3 ) METASTATIC ANAL CARCINOMA / CODE STATUS - Given the advanced nature of the patient &apos;s disease and his failure to respond to chemotherapeutic measures , upon discussion with the patient , the patient &apos;s wife , and the treatment team , the decision was made to pursue comfort measures , and the patient was made DNR / DNI .\n",
      "It was felt that aggressive workup was not indicated at that time .\n",
      "The goal of the patient &apos;s treatment was for maximum comfort and pain control .\n",
      "( 4 ) HYPERCALCEMIA - The patient had been noted to be hypercalcemic with a calcium of 13.3 .\n",

      "Wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9/1/00 .\n",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "This is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4 , 2.5 mm in depth , in 10/02/92 .\n",
      "Subsequently in 10/92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes .\n",
      "He had a recurrence in 05/99 in a similar area which was 2.1 mm in thickness .\n",
      "He had this resected between 9/5/97 and was treated with 6000 C of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity .\n",
      "He has done well since that time and subsequently in 08/98 demonstrated a 4.2 cm splenic lesion .\n",
      "He underwent an open splenectomy in the Fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen .\n",
      "Since that time he has been treated with _______ cells in 1999 and also with Allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule .\n",
      "Most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at Bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer .\n",
      "Since July this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease .\n",
      "Surgical consultation for resection of this for local ___ control was requested .\n",
      "The patient has ___ Dr. Peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years .\n",
      "The other complicating factor in his care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation .\n",
      "In order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder .\n",
      "This magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4-6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle .\n",
      "An magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to Brook Hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma .\n",
      "The patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at 8/24/00 .\n",
      "The positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced .\n",
      "These were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan .\n",
      "The patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion .\n",

      "This is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .\n",
      "There were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .\n",
      "She had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .\n",
      "The patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .\n",
      "The weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .\n",
      "Her appetite was gone .\n",
      "She was having some nausea .\n",
      "No recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .\n",
      "No changes in her breathing .\n",
      "She did not seem sleepy or confused .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .\n",
      "Weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .\n",
      "Temperature 97 .\n",
      "The patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .\n",
      "She could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .\n",
      "She has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .\n",
      "Her lungs were clear .\n",
      "heart ; without murmur or gallop .\n",
      "Her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .\n",
      "soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .\n",
      "No hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\n",
      "She had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .\n",
      "She was moving all four extremities .\n",
      "Her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\n",
      "Hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .\n",
      "Over the following days , she was gently hydrated .\n",
      "Her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .\n",
      "She was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .\n",
      "In the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .\n",
      "She tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .\n",
      "The patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .\n",
      "The family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .\n",
      "They did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .\n",
      "By the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300&apos;s or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .\n",
      "On the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .\n",
      "There had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .\n",
      "Potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .\n",
      "She was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .\n",
      "The problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .\n",
      "The patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .\n",
      "The patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .\n",
      "She will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n",
      "1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.\n",
      "2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.\n",

      "The patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .\n",
      "He became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\n",
      "However , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\n",
      "In the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .\n",
      "He was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .\n",
      "He was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .\n",
      "The circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .\n",
      "The right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .\n",
      "Left ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .\n",
      "A balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .\n",
      "The patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .\n",
      "The procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .\n",
      "The distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .\n",
      "A good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .\n",
      "His peak CPK was in the 3000 range .\n",
      "The patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .\n",
      "He underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .\n",
      "In addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .\n",
      "It was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .\n",
      "In addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .\n",
      "Head CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .\n",
      "He was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .\n",
      "In addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .\n",
      "The patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .\n",
      "This was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .\n",
      "He tolerated it well .\n",
      "The ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .\n",
      "The patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\n",
      "He had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .\n",
      "He was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .\n",
      "He is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .\n",
      "At the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .\n",
      "He has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .\n",
      "Of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .\n",

      "RECOMMENDATIONS :\n",
      "Dr. February 2 , 2003 .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\n",
      "Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\n",
      "Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\n",
      "It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\n",
      "However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\n",
      "Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\n",
      "Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\n",
      "An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\n",
      "Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\n",
      "They agreed with our plan .\n",
      "On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\n",
      "She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\n",
      "With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\n",
      "She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\n",
      "Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\n",
      "She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\n",
      "She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\n",
      "She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\n",
      "She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\n",
      "Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n",
      "The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\n",
      "1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\n",
      "2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\n",
      "3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\n",
      "Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\n",
      "The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\n",
      "DISCHARGE PLAN :\n",
      "Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\n",
      "Check INR three times a week until stable .\n",
      "Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient &apos;s primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\n",
      "Dr. Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\n",
      "The patient will call Dr. Overall &apos;s office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\n",
      "Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\n",
      "Please hold removal if the wound is draining .\n",
      "The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\n",
      "Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\n",
      "These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\n",
      "The patient has been instructed to call Dr. 094-897-3231 .\n",

      "Pediatric consult was done during last admission , normal survey , size equal to dates .\n",
      "The patient was observed on the floor .\n",
      "On hospital day two , the patient had another small bleed which resolved spontaneously .\n",
      "There were no contractions .\n",
      "The baby &apos;s fetal heart tracing was in the 130 range to 140 range , not formally reactive but with great short term and long term variability .\n",
      "After this episode , there was no further bleeding and after three additional days at bed rest , the patient , against our advice , decided to go home .\n",
      "A long discussion including Dr. Haenlodstate Medical Center discussed with the patient the risks of leaving the hospital given a complete previa with several known bleeds in the past as well as instability .\n",
      "The patient understood all risks involved including significant maternal hemorrhage and poor fetal well being .\n",
      "In spite of these potentially serious risks to her and the baby she felt she wanted to be at home .\n",
      "We reminded her that even though she lives 15 minutes away , if she stays in the hospital we can act faster to put in an iv , give her fluids and blood , and perform a c / s if necessary than if she has to come in from home and those few minutes can make a difference between a good and bad outcome .\n",
      "She accepted these risks and opted to be discharged home today .\n",
      "She has offered that she has plenty of care at home including a housekeeper and will be able to remain on bed rest and live in Arvmelapho and knows to immediately come to the hospital for any bleeding .\n",
      "She has family members who will be with her at home and will keep the phone number for the ambulance by the phone .\n",
      "Therefore , the plan was for the patient to be discharged home today on strict bed rest with all precautions given .\n",
